# To use, first edit docker-compose.yml and change the
# port from 8002 to whatever port you like. Or leave it
# alone if you like port 8002. Next run this command:
#
#   docker-compose up
# 
# When you see the URL, copy it and paste it into
# your browser tab. If you want a terminal inside
# the docker image, you can either use the terminal
# provided by Jupyter, or you can issue the following
# command:
#
#   docker exec -it cmr bash
#
# This should log you into the image as the jovyan use.
#
# To transfer files to and from the image, you can use
# the docker cp command as follows:
#
#   docker cp file-to-copy-in cmr:/tmp/
#
# or
#
#   docker cp cmr:/tmp/file-to-copy-out .
#
# To update the cmr image, type
#
#   docker-compose pull
#
